# STM32F4-Quad
An STM32F4 based Quadrotor Flight Controller running on the RTOS uC/OS-III, mainly tested in indoor environment. Including attitude control, position control and trajectory tracking.

A simple vision-based indoor navigation system is also provided, which using active infrared makers as locators.

The Flight Controller is developed in uVison Keil4 using C, and the indoor positioning system is based on OpenCV library.
