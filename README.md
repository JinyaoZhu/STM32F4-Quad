# STM32F4-Quad
An STM32F4 based Quadrotor Flight Controller running on the RTOS uC/OS-III, which mainly tested in the indoor environment. Including attitude control, position control and trajectory tracking.

A simple vision-based indoor navigation system is also provided, which using active infrared makers as the locators.

The Flight Controller is developed in IDE uVison Keil4 using C language, and the indoor positioning system is based on OpenCV library.
