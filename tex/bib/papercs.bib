  abstract = {Compressed Sensing aims to capture attributes of k-sparse signals
	using very few measurements. In the standard compressed sensing paradigm,
	the N ???? C measurement matrix ???? is required to act as a near
	isometry on the set of all k-sparse signals (restricted isometry
	property or RIP). Although it is known that certain probabilistic
	processes generate N ???? C matrices that satisfy RIP with high probability,
	there is no practical algorithm for verifying whether a given sensing
	matrix ???? has this property, crucial for the feasibility of the
	standard recovery algorithms. In contrast, this paper provides simple
	criteria that guarantee that a deterministic sensing matrix satisfying
	these criteria acts as a near isometry on an overwhelming majority
	of k-sparse signals; in particular, most such signals have a unique
	representation in the measurement domain. Probability still plays
	a critical role, but it enters the signal model rather than the construction
	of the sensing matrix. An essential element in our construction is
	that we require the columns of the sensing matrix to form a group
	under pointwise multiplication. The construction allows recovery
	methods for which the expected performance is sub-linear in C, and
	only quadratic in N, as compared to the super-linear complexity in
	C of the Basis Pursuit or Matching Pursuit algorithms; the focus
	on expected performance is more typical of mainstream signal processing
	than the worst case analysis that prevails in standard compressed
	sensing. Our framework encompasses many families of deterministic
	sensing matrices, including those formed from discrete chirps, Delsarte-Goethals
	codes, and extended BCH codes.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of automatically recognizing human faces from
	frontal views with varying expression and illumination, as well as
	occlusion and disguise. We cast the recognition problem as one of
	classifying among multiple linear regression models and argue that
	new theory from sparse signal representation offers the key to addressing
	this problem. Based on a sparse representation computed by C1-minimization,
	we propose a general classification algorithm for (image-based) object
	recognition. This new framework provides new insights into two crucial
	issues in face recognition: feature extraction and robustness to
	occlusion. For feature extraction, we show that if sparsity in the
	recognition problem is properly harnessed, the choice of features
	is no longer critical. What is critical, however, is whether the
	number of features is sufficiently large and whether the sparse representation
	is correctly computed. Unconventional features such as downsampled
	images and random projections perform just as well as conventional
	features such as eigenfaces and Laplacianfaces, as long as the dimension
	of the feature space surpasses certain threshold, predicted by the
	theory of sparse representation. This framework can handle errors
	due to occlusion and corruption uniformly by exploiting the fact
	that these errors are often sparse with respect to the standard (pixel)
	basis. The theory of sparse representation helps predict how much
	occlusion the recognition algorithm can handle and how to choose
	the training images to maximize robustness to occlusion. We conduct
	extensive experiments on publicly available databases to verify the
	efficacy of the proposed algorithm and corroborate the above claims.},

  abstract = {{C}ompressive {S}ensing ({CS}) provides a new paradigm of sub-{N}yquist
	sampling which can be considered as an alternative to {N}yquist sampling
	theorem. {I}n particular, providing that signals are with sparse
	representations in some known space (or domain), information can
	be perfectly preserved even with small amount of measurements captured
	by random projections. {B}esides sparsity prior of signals, the inherent
	structure property underline some specific signals is often exploited
	to enhance the reconstruction accuracy and promote the ability of
	recovery. {I}n this paper, we are aiming to take into account the
	cluster structure property of sparse signals, of which the nonzero
	coefficients appear in clustered blocks. {B}y modeling simultaneously
	both sparsity and cluster prior within a hierarchical statistical
	{B}ayesian framework, a nonparametric algorithm can be obtained through
	variational {B}ayes approach to recover original sparse signals.
	{T}he proposed algorithm could be slightly considered as a generalization
	of {B}ayesian {CS}, but with a consideration on cluster property.
	{C}onsequently, the performance of the proposed algorithm is at least
	as good as {B}ayesian {CS}, which is verified by the experimental
	results.},
