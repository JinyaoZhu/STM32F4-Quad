	of nonsmooth ODEs with an up-to-date reference list of 27 pages.
	It is clearly designed for engineering applications in computational

	of algorithms and their properties...many parts are written in a
	formal mathematical style with precise definitions, followed by results
	stated as Lemma, Proposition, or Theorem (and references to the literature
	for the proofs). This makes the overall work accessible for both,
	researchers in mechanics and in mathematics},

@BOOK{Liberzon2003,
  title = {Switching in Systems and Control},
  publisher = {Birkh{\"a}user},
  year = {2003},
  author = {Daniel Liberzon},
  series = {Systems \& Control: Foundations \& Applications},
  abstract = {This book examines switched systems from a control-theoretic perspective,
	focusing on stability analysis and control synthesis of systems that
	combine continuous dynamics with switching events. The theory of
	such switched systems is related to the study of hybrid systems,
	which has recently attracted considerable attention among control
	theorists, computer scientists, and practicing engineers. Aimed at
	readers with a background in systems and control, this book bridges
	the gap between classical mathematical control theory and the interdisciplinary
	field of hybrid systems. The book is divided into three main parts:
	* Part I introduces the classes of systems studied in the book *
	Part II develops stability theory for switched systems; it covers
	single and multiple Lyapunov function analysis methods, Lie-algebraic
	stability criteria, stability under limited-rate switching, and switched
	systems with various types of useful special structures * Part III
	is devoted to switching control design; it describes several wide
	classes of continuous-time control systems for which the logic-based
	switching paradigm emerges naturally as a control design tool. Switching
	control algorithms for several specific problems are discussed. The
	text adopts a progressive approach, presenting elementary concepts
	informally and more advanced topics with greater rigor. Results are
	first derived for linear systems and then extended to nonlinear systems.
	Full proofs for most results are provided. An extensive bibliography
	and a section of technical and historical notes complete the work.
	Requiring only familiarity with the basic theory of linear systems,
	the book is suitable as a text for a graduate course on switched
	systems and switching control. It may also serve as an introduction
	to this active area of research for control theorists and mathematicians,
	as well as a useful reference for experts in the field.},
